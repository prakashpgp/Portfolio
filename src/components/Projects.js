      <h3>SPS GAME</h3>
      <p>This is a simple yet engaging Stone Paper Scissors game developed in Python. The game allows a player to compete against the computer by choosing one of the three available moves: Stone (Rock), Paper, or Scissors. The program generates a random choice for the computer and compares it with the playerâ€™s selection to determine the winner. This project demonstrates fundamental 
        programming concepts such as conditionals, loops, and user input handling in Python.</p>
